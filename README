Njiiri
======

Njiiri is a graphical MPD client written in Ruby-GTK+.

Installation
============

There isn't a "proper" installer at this point, but run:

    ./install

as root to copy all the files to /usr/local. If you want to install into
a different location, give that as an argument, like

    ./install /opt/local/usr

If you just want to try running it from this directory first, do:

    RUBYLIB=lib ./bin/njiiri

Getting Dependencies
====================

On Debian/Ubuntu:

  apt-get install libglade2-ruby rubygems
  gem install librmpd

On Mac OS X with MacPorts:

  port install rb-gnome
  gem install librmpd

I've gotten reports that Ruby-GNOME 0.15, in MacPorts, fails to build
GTK+ bindings with their (more recent) version of GTK+. If this happens
to you, you'll need to install its dependencies and then build 0.17 or
newer from source.

If you're not sure if your bindings are working correctly, load up irb
and type:

  require 'gtk2'

Controls
========

  * Click anywhere on the time-display progress bar to seek to that
    point in the current track.

  * Grab the handle above the playlist display to resize the album art.
    (Note: fetching album art is not implemented yet.)

  * Select multiple songs to see a count of their total time instead of
    the total time of the entire playlist.

  * Use the drop-down menu next to the server name to reconnect to
    recently-used servers.

  * Double-click playlists in the browser to load them. (This should
    use a single click, but it's not implemented yet.)

  * Press the '/' key in the browser to type in an HTTP stream URL.
