Njiiri
======

Njiiri is a graphical MPD client written in Ruby-GTK+.

Installation
============

There isn't a "proper" installer at this point, but run

    ./install

as root to copy all the files to /usr/local. If you want to install into
a different location, give that as an argument, like

    ./install /opt/local/usr

If you just want to try running it from this directory first, do

    RUBYLIB=lib ./bin/njiiri

Getting Dependencies
====================

On Debian/Ubuntu:

  apt-get install libglade2-ruby rubygems
  gem install librmpd

On Mac OS X with MacPorts:

  port install rb-gnome
  gem install librmpd

I've gotten reports that Ruby-GNOME 0.15, in MacPorts, fails to build
GTK+ bindings with their (more recent) version of GTK+. If this happens
to you, you'll need to install its dependencies and then build 0.17 or
newer from source.

Controls
========

  * Click anywhere on the time-display progress bar to seek to that
    point in the current track.

  * Click the expander next to the status display to see library stats
    and control crossfade/repeat/random settings.

  * Grab the handle above the playlist display to resize the album art.
    (Note: fetching album art is not implemented yet.)

  * Select multiple songs to see a count of their total time instead of
    the total time of the entire playlist.

  * Use the drop-down menu next to the "Connect" button to reconnect to
    recently-used servers.

  * Double-click playlists in the browser to load them.

  * Press the '/' key in the browser to type in an HTTP stream URL.

  * Right-click the toolbar for a menu allowing you to stop playback
    completely. (Note: This menu should be attached to the pause button,
    but currently cannot be due to technical limitations.)
