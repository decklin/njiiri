0.3.0 (2008-10-21)
==================

  * Make "Play Now" push on to the end if we've already come to a stop, so
    that we don't end up back at the beginning of the playlist later.

  * Fix server menu; it now updates as you use it, with the most recent
    server first, allows multiple ports on one host, and trims more than
    5 entries.

  * Save the sizes of playlist/browser columns (with the exception of Time,
    which for obscure implementation reasons needs to be auto-sized).

  * Fix time display at 0:00 within a normal (non-stream) song.

0.2.1 (2008-10-20)
==================

  * Fix install site_ruby path. (The install script is an ugly hack; it will
    be replaced.)

0.2.0 (2008-10-19)
==================

  * Initial release.
