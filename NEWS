0.3.9 (2009-03-18)
==================

  * Drag-and-drop support!

  * Simplified toolbar and moved the cue function to its own button (for
    now). Fixed a few minor cueing bugs.

  * Prevent the time column in the browser from getting too big.

0.3.2 (2009-01-10)
==================

  * Generate fake "album art" color swatches based on a hash of the artist
    and album. When fetching cover images is finally implemented, this will
    be the fallback. For now, I rather like it.

  * Added a simple, hacky version of the "Cue Next" function. Because we
    operate by repeatedly polling MPD, sometimes the next song starts
    playing for a fraction of a second before we can pause and rewind it.

  * Fix a librmpd crash when adding songs containing quotes.

  * Add a context menu for the playlist to select and delete songs.

0.3.1 (2009-01-02)
==================

  * Rearranged interface, making the menu with "Stop" more accessible.
    No more expanding-statusbar clutter.

  * Implemented search.

  * Fixed crashes with stale callbacks and on connection failure.

0.3.0 (2008-10-21)
==================

  * Make "Play Now" push on to the end if we've already come to a stop, so
    that we don't end up back at the beginning of the playlist later.

  * Fix server menu; it now updates as you use it, with the most recent
    server first, allows multiple ports on one host, and trims more than
    5 entries.

  * Save the sizes of playlist/browser columns (with the exception of Time,
    which for obscure implementation reasons needs to be auto-sized).

  * Fix time display at 0:00 within a normal (non-stream) song.

0.2.1 (2008-10-20)
==================

  * Fix install site_ruby path. (The install script is an ugly hack; it will
    be replaced.)

0.2.0 (2008-10-19)
==================

  * Initial release.
